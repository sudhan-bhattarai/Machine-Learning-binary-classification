# Machine-Learning-binary-classification
Comparing Logistic regression, Support vector machine, Decision tree, Random forest and Gradient Boosting models for binary classification ML problem.

This project is about modeling a binary classification ML algorithm.
This project uses 80/20 train test split with KFolds equals to 5 for cross validation.
First step is the data processing.
Secondly,
Fitting the data into Logistic regression, Support vector machine, Decision tree, Random forest and Gradient Boosting.
Storing the F1-scores for train data and solver of each model.
Finally, choosing the best model based on best test score.
